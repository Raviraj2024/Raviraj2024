So, Hello everyone there,
  I am Raviraj Singh Rathore, Btech CSE student currently in 3rd year and just now started building projects.
  I have done courses on prompt engineering on LLMs' and now started with more in programming.
  Currently I can write proficient codes with help of LLM like ChatGpt with my prompting skills, but it took me time to understand those codes so I have just started learning multiple languages to understand the codes faster than before.
  This is all from my side Developers that side.
